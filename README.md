## Code License
We carefully considered several license choices for this project

BSD3 - people can take and reuse without attribution
GPL - some people won't touch code with a 10 foot pole
Apache license - people who add to your code can't add patented things in

After going through these consideration, we chose the BSD3 license for this project.

## Data license

There are also many considerations for data licensing. Here however, there 
was not much debate. As someone closely connected with the Dryad project, CC0
was the clear choice.

## Data metadata

### mnm-data
This is data collected from the 'Fun Size' M and M packages. The color of each MandM is counted and entered into the relevant column. Typically one package
is observed per day, but there are some days where there may be more than one observation. Each package observed has a unique identifier.
