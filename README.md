Tracking candy type distribution

## Code License
We carefully considered several license choices for this project

BSD3 - people can take and reuse without attribution
GPL - some people won't touch code with a 10 foot pole
Apache license - people who add to your code can't add patented things in

After going through these consideration, we chose the BSD3 license for this project.

## Data license

There are also many considerations for data licensing. Here however, there 
was not much debate. As someone closely connected with the Dryad project, CC0
was the clear choice.
